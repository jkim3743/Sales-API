# API stands for Application Programming Interface. In the context of APIs, the word Application refers to any software with a distinct function. Interface can be thought of as a contract of service between two applications. This contract defines how the two communicate with each other using requests and responses.

In this project, I will access data from USAC open source platform using the Socrata Open Data APIâ€™s SOQL language.

This project is to do the following:
  1. Retrieve API data
  2. Data cleaning 
  3. Create a dashboard
